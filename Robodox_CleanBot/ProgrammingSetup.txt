	- Scroll to the library called "Encoder" by Paul Stoffregen
	- Install the latest version listed

2) Install the PS2X Library
	- Sketch/Include Library/Include Library/Add .zip Library
	- Navigate to your Arduino code libary (where the .ino file is)
	- Choose the PS2X_lib.zip file

3) Plug in the Arduino to a USB port

4) Go to Tools/Board and choose "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560"

5) Go to Tools/Port and choose the COM port for the Arduino
	- If you see multiple ports and do not know which one is for the Arduino, unplug the Arduino, and go back to Tools/Port and see which port disappeared - that's the one.  OR, plug in the Arduino and see which on appears.

6) Click the Check-mark icon on the upper-left.
	- The program will compile and if successful, everything will be green with no orange error messages

7) Once you've successfully compiled the program, click the Right-arrow icon to upload the program to the Arduino.
